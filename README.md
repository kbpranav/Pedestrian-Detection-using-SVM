# Pedestrian-Detection-using-SVM
Real-time Pedestrian detection using stand-alone LinearSVC in python.

The designed Pedestrian detection system works efficiently in outdoor conditions. The proposed work is implemented without using any standard object detection modules/libraries.

Necessary Python Libraries:
1. Scikit-learn
2. Numpy 
3. tkinter
4. Opencv-python


Main file: Classifier_SVM.py 

Trained model: finalized_model.sav 

Download the dataset from here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uxtnKJe6Wxvb59HSW1EgoQ-tC9oCWkZV?usp=sharing and store it in folder named "database", which should be in the same directory as Classifier_SVM.py
